# CodeCollection Authors
Welcome to the RunWhen CodeCollection contributing guide! Thank you for your interest and we're excited to have you be a part of our community.

By joining our community, we enroll you in our CodeCollection Authors Program, which in addition to collaborating with us, has some benefits that come with it, in additon to SWAG!

Why join now?

1. Contributions to a high profile open source community as shown in your personal github profile is attractive for potential employers looking for DevOps, SRE and Developer candidates.  (This includes RunWhen!  In our hiring process for example, we weight a candidates’ github profile materially higher than their resume.)
2. As we continue to develop RunWhen profile pages, contributions to Code Bundles will be prominently displayed to make for excellent compliments to your github profile for potential employers or consulting clients.
3. There is the opportunity to harvest hard-won operational experience in to material amount of supplementary income, growing as RunWhen grows.
4. By joining early and providing high impact contributions, there is the opportunity to be a thought leader in an emerging community of highly competent and passionate people including some of the top SREs in the industry.

Head over to [rewards](docs/rewards.md) for details on some of the benefits of being an author.

## The Author Journey
We assume that authors and their CodeCollections will roughly go through these steps:

1. Following the [developer docs](docs/developer_docs/README.md), the author will setup their CodeCollection and run their first codebundle locally.
2. RunWhen will provide a platform workspace to try out your codebundles on the platform.
3. The platform will begin generating public documentation pages for your Code Collection and Code Bundles to help you promote your work and ‘advertise’ it on the RunWhen public slack instance.  You can also use the public slack instance to connect with RunWhen customers and engineers for feedback as you iterate on the initial collection.
4. When you are ready, connect with a member of the RunWhen team via DM on the public slack instance about moving your code collection repository to the https://github.com/runwhen-contrib organization.  

The criteria for inclusion in runwhen-contrib are expected to evolve very rapidly over the course of 2023, so we welcome and recommend a live conversation with our team to supplement this document.  

Once your Code Collection is accepted in the runwhen-contrib organization, it is considered “in the program.”  The code bundles are accessible via RunWhen search, and can be included in the [RunWhen Local tool](https://docs.runwhen.com/public/runwhen-local/introduction-runwhen-local). This kicks off the royalty and other bonus payments detailed below. Members of the RunWhen team will likely reach out to see if you are interested in press releases, joint blog posts, LinkedIn posts or speaking opportunities to promote your work and your github and RunWhen profile.
