# CodeCollection Coding Guide
[WIP]

This is our general CodeCollection coding guide for any code within a CodeCollection; things like language style guides, what formatters to use, as well as emergant design patterns that we see with codebundles will be detailed here. We'll be iterating on this doc a lot so check back often!

- Review the Google [python style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html); we generally try to follow it but do stray when needed for certain designs.

- Review the [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html) docs, although a strong understanding of Robot is not needed. We try to handle complex logic at the python level and use Robot like a configuration language.



#### TODO: more coming soon...
