# Setting Up CI For Your CodeCollection
[WIP]

The setup process for CI around CodeCollections has some manual setup steps right now and involves some particular configurations on the platform, as you'll use a target workspace as your "runner" for codebundles you'd like to test.

Just reach out to us if you'd like us to walk you through this setup process until we've created a general template for all CodeCollections.
